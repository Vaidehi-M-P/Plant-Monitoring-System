# Plant-Monitoring-System
This project implements a simple plant monitoring system that measures temperature and humidity using a DHT11 sensor. The system uses an LCD display to show the current temperature and humidity readings. A buzzer sounds an alert if a certain condition is met, and an LED is used to indicate the status of the system.
